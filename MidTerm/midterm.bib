abstract = "The amount of storage needed to simulate a nondeterministic tape bounded Turingmachine on a deterministic Turing machine is investigated. Results include the following: Theorem. A nondeterministic L(n)-tape bounded Turing machine can be simulated by a deterministic [L(n)]2-tape bounded Turing machine, provided L(n)â‰¥log2n. Computations of nondeterministic machines are shown to correspond to threadings of certain mazes. This correspondence is used to produce a specific set, namely the set of all codings of threadable mazes, such that, if there is any set which distinguishes nondeterministic tape complexity classes from deterministic tape complexity classes, then this is one such set."
